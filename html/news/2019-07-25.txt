Xdebug 2.8.0beta1 is out!
<p>This is the first beta release in the Xdebug 2.8 series.</p>

<p>The 2.8 series primarily adds support for PHP 7.4, but also improves
Xdebug's breakpoint functionality by adding support for the
'resolved_breakpoint' flag.</p>

<p>This first beta release makes Xdebug compile with the PHP 7.4beta1 release,
and also fixes a handful of other bugs.</p>

<p>Everybody is encouraged to try out this new version, but please be aware
that Xdebug 2.8.0beta1 <b>is not fully ready</b>. Which means that crashes
can still occur. If you find any problems, please report them to the <a
href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates.php#x_2_8_0beta1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>This release also contains contributions by: <i>Joe Watkins, and
GCth</i> — Thanks!</p>

<p>I have written a
<a href="https://derickrethans.nl/xdebug-experience.html">blog post "The
Xdebug Experience"</a> about the future of Xdebug, and how you can help
through becoming a supporter on

I also write monthly reports on Xdebug's progress on <a
