Displays information about a variable
void
[string varname [, ...]]
FUNC_VAR_DUMP

TXT:
This function displays structured information about one or more variables
that includes its type, value and refcount information. Arrays are explored
recursively with values. This function is implemented differently from PHP's <a
href='http://php.net/debug-zval-dump'>debug_zval_dump()</a> function in order
to work around the problems that that function has because the variable itself
is actually passed to the function. Xdebug's version is better as it uses the
variable name to lookup the variable in the internal symbol table and accesses
all the properties directly without having to deal with actually passing a
variable to a function. The result is that the information that this function
returns is much more accurate than PHP's own function for showing zval
information.

TXT:
Support for anything but simple variable names (such as <i>"a[2]"</i> below)
is supported since Xdebug 2.2.4.

EXAMPLE:
<?php
    $a = array(1, 2, 3);
    $b =& $a;
    $c =& $a[2];

    xdebug_debug_zval('a');
    xdebug_debug_zval("a[2]");
?>

RESULT:
a: (refcount=2, is_ref=1)=array (
	0 =&gt; (refcount=1, is_ref=0)=1,
	1 =&gt; (refcount=1, is_ref=0)=2,
	2 =&gt; (refcount=2, is_ref=1)=3)
a[2]: (refcount=2, is_ref=1)=3
