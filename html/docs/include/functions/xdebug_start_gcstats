Start the collection of garbage collection statistics
[ string gcstats_file ]
FUNC_GARBAGE_COLLECTION

TXT:
Start tracing garbage collection attempts from this point to the file in the
<i>gcstats_file</i> parameter. If no filename is given, then garbage collection stats file
will be placed in the directory as configured by the [CFG:gc_stats_output_dir] setting.

TXT:
In case a file name is given as first parameter, the name is relative
to the current working directory. This current working directory might be
different than you expect it to be, so please use an absolute path in case you
specify a file name. Use the PHP function <a
href='http://php.net/getcwd'>getcwd()</a> to figure out what the current
working directory is.

TXT:
If [CFG:gc_stats_enable] is
enabled, then filename depends on the [CFG:gc_stats_output_name] setting.

TXT:
The full path and filename to which Xdebug collects statistics into is returned from this
function. This will be either the filename you pass in, or the auto generated filename if no
filename has been passed in.
