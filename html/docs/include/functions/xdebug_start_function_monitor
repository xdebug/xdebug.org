Starts function monitoring
void
array $listOfFunctionsToMonitor
FUNC_FUNCTION_TRACE

TXT:
This function starts the monitoring of functions that were given in a list as
argument to this function. Function monitoring allows you to find out where in
your code the functions that you provided as argument are called from. This can
be used to track where old, or, discouraged functions are used.

EXAMPLE:
<?php
xdebug_start_function_monitor( [ 'strrev', 'array_push' ] );
?>

TXT:
You can also add class methods and static methods to the array that defines
which functions to monitor. For example, to catch static calls to
DramModel::canSee and dynamic calls to Whisky->drink, you would start the
monitor with:

EXAMPLE:
<?php
xdebug_start_function_monitor( [ 'DramModel::canSee', 'Whisky->drink'] );
?>

TXT:
The defined functions are case sensitive, and a dynamic call to a static method
will not be caught.
