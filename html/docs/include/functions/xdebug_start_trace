= xdebug_start_trace
Starts a new function trace
?string
?string $traceFile = null, int $options = 0
FUNC_FUNCTION_TRACE|FUNC_FLAMEGRAPH

TXT:
Start tracing function calls from this point to the file in the
<code>$trace_file</code> parameter. If no filename is given, then the trace file will
be placed in the directory as configured by the [CFG:output_dir] setting.

TXT:
In case a file name is given as first parameter, the name is relative
to the current working directory. This current working directory might be
different than you expect it to be, so please use an absolute path in case you
specify a file name. Use the PHP function <a
href='http://php.net/getcwd'>getcwd()</a> to figure out what the current
working directory is.

TXT:
The name of the trace file is <code>{$trace_file}.xt</code>. If the trace was started at
the beginning of the request because [CFG:start_with_request] is set to
<code>yes</code>, then the filename depends on the
[CFG:trace_output_name] setting.

TXT:
The <i>options</i> parameter is a bitfield;
currently there are four options:

<dl>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_APPEND (0x01)</dt>
<dd>Trace file data will be appended to an already existing file with the same
name, instead of it being overwritten.</dd>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_COMPUTERIZED (0x02)</dt>
<dd>Switches the file format to the tab separated format. The format is described in
the [CFG:trace_format] setting as "format 1".</dd>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_HTML (0x04)</dt>
<dd>Switches to a file format that shows data as an HTML table.</dd>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_NAKED_FILENAME (0x08)</dt>
<dd>With the <i>XDEBUG_TRACE_NAKED_FILENAME</i> flag set, <code>.xt</code> is
not added automatically to the end of trace file names.</dd>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_FLAMEGRAPH_COST (0x10)</dt>
<dd>Switches to a file format that contains data to create a flame graph visualing CPU time.</dd>
<dt>XDEBUG_TRACE_FLAMEGRAPH_MEM (0x20)</dt>
<dd>Switches to a file format that contains data to create a flame graph visualing memory usage.</dd>
</dl>

TXT:
The <code>XDEBUG_TRACE_FLAMEGRAPH_COST</code> and
<code>XDEBUG_TRACE_FLAMEGRAPH_MEM</code> flags are used to create flame graph
data. [FEAT:flamegraphs] are described separately.

EXAMPLE:
<?php
xdebug_start_trace("/tmp/xdebug.trace", XDEBUG_TRACE_COMPUTERIZED|XDEBUG_TRACE_NAKED_FILENAME);
?>

TXT:
The line above creates a file named <code>/tmp/xdebug.trace</code>.

TXT:
It does not add <code>.xt</code> to the end of the filename (due to
<code>XDEBUG_TRACE_NAKED_FILENAME</code>).

TXT:
The tab-separated trace file format is used due to
<code>XDEBUG_TRACE_COMPUTERIZED</code>.

TXT:
The settings [CFG:collect_assignments], [CFG:collect_params], and
[CFG:collect_return] influence what information is logged to the trace file and
the setting [CFG:trace_format] influences the format of the trace file.

TXT:
The full path and filename to which Xdebug traces is returned from this
function. This will be either the filename you pass in (potentially with
<code>.xt</code> added), or the auto generated filename if no filename has been
passed in.
