FUNC_CODE_COVERAGE

TXT:
This function starts gathering the information for code coverage. The
information that is collected consists of an two dimensional array with as
primary index the executed filename and as secondary key the line number. The
value in the elements represents whether the line has been executed or whether
it has unreachable lines.

TXT:
The returned values for each line are:
<ul>
	<li><code>1</code>: this line was executed</li>
	<li><code>-1</code>: this line was not executed</li>
	<li><code>-2</code>: this line did not have executable code on it</li>
</ul>

Value <code>-1</code> is only returned when the <code>XDEBUG_CC_UNUSED</code>
is enabled and value <code>-2</code> is only returned when both
<code>XDEBUG_CC_UNUSED</code> and <code>XDEBUG_CC_DEAD_CODE</code> are enabled.

TXT:
This function has two options, which act as a bitfield:

<dl>
<dt>XDEBUG_CC_UNUSED</dt>
<dd>Enables scanning of code to figure out which line has executable code.
Without this option you the returned array will only have lines in them that
were actually executed.</dd>

<dt>XDEBUG_CC_DEAD_CODE</dt>
<dd>Enables branch analyzes to figure out whether code can be executed.</dd>
</dl>

Enabling those options make code coverage drastically slower.

TXT:
You can use the options as shown in the following example.

EXAMPLE:
<?php
xdebug_start_code_coverage( XDEBUG_CC_UNUSED | XDEBUG_CC_DEAD_CODE );
?>
