<p>* can be any of COOKIE, FILES, GET, POST, REQUEST, SERVER, SESSION.
These seven settings control which data from the superglobals is shown when an
error situation occurs.</p>
<p>Each of those php.ini setting can consist of a comma separated list of
variables from this superglobal to dump, or <code>*</code> for all of them.
Make sure you do not add spaces in this setting.</p>
<p>In order to dump the REMOTE_ADDR and the REQUEST_METHOD when an error
occurs, and all GET parameters, add these settings:</p>
<pre>
xdebug.dump.SERVER = REMOTE_ADDR,REQUEST_METHOD
xdebug.dump.GET = *
</pre>
