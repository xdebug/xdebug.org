If set to a value, it is used as filename to a file to which all remote
debugger communications are logged. The file is always opened in append-mode,
and will therefore not be overwritten by default. There is no concurrency
protection available. The format of the file looks something like:
<pre>

&lt;- step_into -i 1
-&gt; &lt;response xmlns="urn:debugger_protocol_v1" xmlns:xdebug="http://xdebug.org/db ... &gt;&lt;/response&gt;
