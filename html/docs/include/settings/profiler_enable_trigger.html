<p>When this setting is set to 1, you can trigger the generation of profiler
files by using the XDEBUG_PROFILE GET/POST parameter, or set a cookie with the
name XDEBUG_PROFILE. This will then write the profiler data to
[CFG:output_dir:defined directory]. In order to prevent the profiler
to generate profile files for each request, you need to set
[CFG:profiler_enable] to 0. Access to the trigger itself can be configured
through [CFG:profiler_enable_trigger_value].</p>
