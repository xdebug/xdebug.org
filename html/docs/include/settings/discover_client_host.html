<p>If enabled, Xdebug will first try to connect to the client that made the
HTTP request. It checks the <code>$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']</code> and
<code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> variables to find out which hostname or IP
address to use.</p>

<p>If [CFG:client_discovery_header] is configured, then the <code>$_SERVER</code>
variable with that configured name will be checked instead of the default variables.</p>

<p>If Xdebug can not connect to a debugging client as found in one of the HTTP
headers, it will fall back to the hostname or IP address as configured by the
[CFG:client_host] setting.</p>

<p>This setting does not apply for debugging through the CLI, as the
<code>$_SERVER</code> header variables are not available there.</p>

<p class="note">This setting can additionally be configured through the
<code>XDEBUG_CONFIG</code>
<a href="/docs/all_settings#XDEBUG_CONFIG">environment variable</a>.</p>

<p class="warning">Please note that there is no filter
available, and anybody who can connect to the webserver will then be able to
start a debugging session, even if their address does not match
[CFG:client_host].</p>
