<p>This setting controls which Xdebug features are enabled.</p>

<p class="note">This setting can only be set in <code>php.ini</code> or
files like <code>99-xdebug.ini</code> that are read when a PHP process starts
(directly, or through php-fpm). You can not set this value in
<code>.htaccess</code> and <code>.user.ini</code> files, which are read
per-request, nor through <code>php_admin_value</code> as used in Apache VHOSTs
and PHP-FPM pools.</p>

<p>The following values are accepted:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>off</code></dt>
<dd>Nothing is enabled. Xdebug does no work besides checking whether
functionality is enabled. Use this setting if you want close to 0
overhead.</dd>

<dt><code>develop</code></dt>
<dd>Enables [FEAT:develop] including the overloaded [FUNC:var_dump].</dd>

<dt><code>coverage</code></dt>
<dd>Enables [FEAT:code_coverage] to generate code coverage reports, mainly in
combination with
<a href="https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.0/code-coverage-analysis.html">PHPUnit</a>.</dd>

<dt><code>debug</code></dt>
<dd>Enables [FEAT:step_debug]. This can be used to step through your code while it
is running, and analyse values of variables.</dd>

<dt><code>gcstats</code></dt>
<dd>Enables [FEAT:garbage_collection] to collect statistics about PHP's Garbage
Collection Mechanism.</dd>

<dt><code>profile</code></dt>
<dd>Enables [FEAT:profiler], with which you can analyse performance bottlenecks
with tools like <a href="/docs/profiler#kcachegrind">KCacheGrind</a>.</dd>

<dt><code>trace</code></dt>
<dd>Enables the [FEAT:trace] and [FEAT:flamegraphs] features.</dd>
<dd>The former allows
you record every function call, including arguments, variable assignment, and
return value that is made during a request to a file.</dd>
<dd>The latter can be used to visualise certain performance characteristics.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can enable multiple modes at the same time by comma separating their
identifiers as value to [CFG:mode]: <code>xdebug.mode=develop,trace</code>.</p>

<h4>XDEBUG_MODE environment variable</h4>
<p>You can also set Xdebug's mode by setting the <code>XDEBUG_MODE</code>
environment variable on the command-line; this will take precedence over the
[CFG:mode] setting, but will not change the value of the [CFG:mode]
setting.</p>

<p class="warning">Some web servers have a configuration option to
prevent environment variables from being propagated to PHP and Xdebug.
<br/><br/>
For example, PHP-FPM has a <a
href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php#clear-env"><code>clear_env</code></a>
configuration setting that is <code>on</code> by default, which you will
need to turn <code>off</code> if you want to use <code>XDEBUG_MODE</code>.
<br/><br/>
Make sure that your web server does not clean the environment, or specifically
allows the <code>XDEBUG_MODE</code> environment variable to be passed on.</p>
