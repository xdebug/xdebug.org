<p>Linux and Windows <em>only</em>.</p>

<p>When set to <code>"default"</code> (the default value) or
<code>"time"</code>, then Xdebug will poll an anonymous pipe (Linux) or Named
Pipe (Windows) every 25 ms for a command.</p>

<p>A command can currently be used to:
<ul>
	<li>request process information (time, memory usage, and entry file)</li>
	<li>initiate a debugging session by (trying to) connect to the IDE</li>
	<li>force a breakpoint</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You should use the [FEAT:xdebugctl] tool to interact with this control
socket.</p>

<p>When this setting is set to <code>"off"</code>, then Xdebug will not create
a control socket, and hence you can't send commands to it.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p>
If your system (or container) does not have a reliable <em>TSC</em> clock, then
<code>"default"</code> does <em>not enable</em> control sockets. You have to
change this setting to <code>"time"</code> instead.<br/><br/>
This is to prevent slowing down PHP by wasting time to check the current time
through a slow clock interface.<br/><br/>
If Xdebug detects that the TSC clock is not available, it will print a warning
in the log file.<br/><br/>
You can find out which clock source Xdebug has detected in [FUNC:xdebug_info]
output.<br/><br/>
</p>
</div>

<p class="note">
You can programatically check whether control sockets are enabled for your PHP
build by calling [FUNC:xdebug_info] with <code>extension-flags</code> as
category. If control sockets are available, then <code>control-socket</code> is
returned in the resulting array. If a TSC clock is available, then
<code>tsc</code> is also present in the resulting array.
