<p>By default Xdebug overloads var_dump() with its own improved version
		for displaying variables when the html_errors php.ini setting is set to
		<code>1</code> or <code>2</code>. In case you do not want that, you can
		set this setting to <code>0</code>, but check first if it's not smarter
		to turn off html_errors.</p>
		<p>You can also use <code>2</code> as value for this setting. Besides
		formatting the var_dump() output nicely, it will also add filename and 
		line number to the output. The [CFG:file_link_format] setting is also
		respected. <i>(New in Xdebug 2.3)</i></p>
		<p>Before Xdebug 2.4, the default value of this setting was
		<code>1</code>.</p>
