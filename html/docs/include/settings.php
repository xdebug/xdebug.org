<h4>Firefox on Linux</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open <a href="about:config">about:config</a></li>
<li>Add a new boolean setting "network.protocol-handler.expose.xdebug"</li>
<li>Add the following into a shell script <code>~/bin/ff-xdebug.sh</code>:
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

f=`echo $1 | cut -d @ -f 1 | sed \'s/xdebug:\/\///\'`
l=`echo $1 | cut -d @ -f 2`
</pre>
Add to that one of (depending whether you have komodo or gvim):
<ul>
	<li><code>komodo $f -l $l</code></li>
	<li><code>gvim --remote-tab +$l $f</code></li>
</ul>
</pre>
</li>
<li>Make the script executable with <code>chmod +x ~/bin/ff-xdebug.sh</code></li>
<li>Set the [CFG:file_link_format] setting to <code>xdebug://%f@%l</code></li>
</ul>

<h4>Windows and netbeans</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create the file <code>netbeans.bat</code> and save it in your path (<code>C:\Windows</code> will work):
<pre>
@echo off
setlocal enableextensions enabledelayedexpansion
set NETBEANS=%1
set FILE=%~2
%NETBEANS% --nosplash --console suppress --open "%FILE:~19%"
nircmd win activate process netbeans.exe
