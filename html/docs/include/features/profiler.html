<h2>Introduction <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">#</a></h2>

<p>Xdebug's Profiler is a powerful tool that gives you the ability to analyse
your PHP code and determine bottlenecks or generally see which parts of your
code are slow and could use a speed boost. The profiler also collects
information about how much memory is being used, and which functions and
methods increase memory usage.</p>

<p>The profiler in Xdebug outputs
profiling information in the form of a Cachegrind compatible file.  This allows
you to use the excellent <a href="https://kcachegrind.github.io">KCacheGrind</a>
tool (Linux, KDE) to analyse your profiling data. If you are on Linux
you can install KCacheGrind with your favourite package manager.</p>

<p>If you are on Windows, there are precompiled <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qcachegrindwin/">QCacheGrind</a>
binaries available. (QCacheGrind is KCacheGrind without KDE bindings).</p>

<p>If you are on Mac OSX, homebrew has a formula for <a
href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qcachegrind">QCacheGrind</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a web based front-end called <a
href="https://github.com/jokkedk/webgrind">Webgrind</a>.</p>

<p>In case you can not use KDE (or do not want to use KDE) the kcachegrind
package also comes with a perl script "ct_annotate" which produces ASCII output
from the profiler trace files.</p>

<h2>Starting The Profiler <a name="starting" href="#starting">#</a></h2>

<p>In your <code>php.ini</code>, <code>99-xdebug.ini</code>, or other
distribution specific PHP ini file, change (or set) the [CFG:mode] setting to
<code>profile</code>. Please refer to <a
href='/docs/install#configure-php'>Configure PHP</a> in the documentation to
find out which PHP ini file to modify.</p>

<p>This
instructs Xdebug to start writing profiling information into the directory
configured with the [CFG:output_dir] directive. The name of the generated file
always starts with "<span class="filename">cachegrind.out.</span>" and ends by
default with the PID (process ID) of the PHP (or Apache) process. You can
change the filename format with [CFG:xdebug.profiler_output_name]. Make sure
you have enough space in your [CFG:output_dir] as the amount of information
generated by the profiler can be enormous for complex scripts.</p>

<p>You can also selectively enable the profiler by setting
[CFG:start_with_request#trigger] to <code>trigger</code>. You can then enable
the profiler by using an environment value, a GET/POST parameter, or COOKIE
variable of the name <code>XDEBUG_TRIGGER</code>. The Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
extensions that can be used to enable the step debugger (see <a
href="/docs/remote#firefox-ext">HTTP Debug Sessions</a>) can also be used with
this setting.</p>

<p>Xdebug adds the HTTP header <code>X-Xdebug-Profile-Filename</code> to a
request that is being profiled. This header contains the name of the file that
holds the profiling information for that request.</p>

<h2>Analysing Profiles <a name="Analysing-Profiles" href="#Analysing-Profiles">#</a></h2>

<p>After a profile information file has been generated you can open it with
<a href="https://kcachegrind.github.io">KCacheGrind</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/docs/kc-open.png"/></p>

<p>Once the file is opened you have plenty of information available in the
different panes of <a href="https://kcachegrind.github.io">KCacheGrind</a>. On the left side you find the "Flat Profile"
pane showing all functions in your script sorted by time spent in this function,
and all its children.
<img class="l" src="/images/docs/kc-profile.png" align="left"/>
The second column "Self" shows the time spent in this function (without its
children), the third column "Called" shows how often a specific function was
called and the last column "Function" shows the name of the function. Xdebug
changes internal PHP function names by prefixing the function name with
"php::" and include files are handled in a special way too. Calls to include
(and include_once, require and require_once) are followed by "::" and the
filename of the included file. In the screenshot on the left you can see this
for "include::/home/httpd/ez_34/v..." and an example of an internal PHP
function is "php::mysql_query".
<img class="r" src="/images/docs/kc-percentage.png" align="right"/>
The numbers in the first two columns can be
either percentages of the full running time of the script (like in the
example) or absolute time (1 unit is 1/1.000.000th of a second). You can
switch between the two modes with the button you see on the right.</p>

<p>The pane on the right contains an upper and lower pane. The upper one
shows information about which functions called the current selected function
("eztemplatedesignresource-&gt;executecompiledtemplate in the screenshot).
<img class="r" src="/images/docs/kc-right-call.png" align="right"/>
The lower pane shows information about the functions that the current selected
function called.</p>

<p>The "Cost" column in the upper pane shows the time spent in the current
selected function while being called from the function in the list. The numbers
in the Cost column added up will always be 100%. The "Cost" column in the lower
pane shows the time spent while calling the function from the list. While adding
the numbers in this list up, you will most likely never reach 100% as the
selected function itself will also takes time to execute.</p>

<p>The "All Callers" and "All Calls" tabs show not only the direct calls from
<img class="l" src="/images/docs/kc-right-callers.png" align="left"/>
which the function was called respectively all directly made
function calls but also function calls made more levels up and down.
The upper pane in the screenshot on the left shows all functions calling the
current selected one, both directly and indirectly with other functions
inbetween them on the stack. The "Distance" column shows how many function
calls are between the listed and the current selected one (-1). If there are
different distances between two functions, it is shown as a range (for example
"5-24"). The number in parentheses is the median distance. The lower pane is
similar except that it shows information on functions called from the current
selected one, again either direct or indirect.</p>
