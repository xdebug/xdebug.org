<h2>Introduction <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">#</a></h2>

<p>Xdebug interacts with IDEs to provide step debugging functionality, and
therefore you also need to configure an IDE that knows how to talk to Xdebug
with the open <a href="/docs/dbgp">DBGp</a> protocol.</p>

<p>This protocol is supported by nearly every PHP IDE (including Visual Studio 
Code and PhpStorm), and also by text-based editors. There is
also a simple [FEAT:dbgpClient] available as part of the Xdebug project,
but it is strongly recommended that you use an IDE for debugging. (An <a
href="#clients">overview of third party clients</a> is available further down
this page.)</p>

<h2>Configuring Step Debugging <a name="configure" href="#configure">#</a></h2>

<p>In your <code>php.ini</code>, <code>99-xdebug.ini</code>, or other
distribution specific PHP ini file, change (or set) the [CFG:mode] setting to
<code>debug</code>. Please refer to <a
href='/docs/install#configure-php'>Configure PHP</a> in the documentation to
find out which PHP ini file to modify.</p>

<p>In set-ups where PHP/Xdebug and your IDE all run on the
same host, this is all you need to configure on the PHP and Xdebug side.
<small>(Skip to <a href='#activate_debugger'>Activating the Debugger</a> if
that's the case.)</small> </p>

<p>If PHP/Xdebug run on a different machine, virtual host, or in a Docker
container, you need to tell Xdebug where to make the debugging connection
<b>to</b>, as it is Xdebug that initiates the communication to the IDE, and not
the other way around.</p>

<p>If PHP/Xdebug run on a different machine in the same sub-net, and you run
your browser on the same host as your IDE, then you set the
[CFG:discover_client_host] setting to <code>1</code>. Xdebug will then use the
HTTP headers to find out the IP address of the host that initiated the
debugging request, and use that IP address to connect to. This is a common
way of set-up if you are sharing a development server among you and your team
mates.</p>

<p>In more complex set-ups you need to configure the host and port that Xdebug
connects to yourself. With [CFG:client_host] you can select the IP or hostname
of the machine that runs your IDE, and with [CFG:client_port] the TCP port.
Make sure that the host running PHP/Xdebug can connect to your IDE with the
configured IP address and port, and that there is no firewall or other software
blocking an incoming connection.</p>

<h2>Activating Step Debugging <a name="activate_debugger" href="#activate_debugger">#</a></h2>

<p>In the default configuration, the debugger activates if a "trigger" is
present, although it's possible to instruct the debugger to always initiate a
debugging session by setting [CFG:start_with_request] to <code>yes</code>.</p>

<p>Which trigger to use depends on whether you're debugging a PHP application
through <a href='#activate_browser'>a browser</a>, or on the <a
href='#activate_cmdline'>command line</a>, such as when running unit tests.</p>

<h3>Command Line</h3>

<p>To signal the debugger to initiate connections, Xdebug will look whether the
<code>XDEBUG_SESSION</code> environment variable is present.</p> <p>The value
of the variable does not matter unless you have set up a trigger value with
[CFG:trigger_value].</p>

<p>
On Unix like platforms, you can set it like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
export XDEBUG_SESSION=1
</pre>
<p>
On Windows, you set the environment like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
set XDEBUG_SESSION=1
</pre>

<p>When you now run a php script with <code>php myscript.php</code> or
<code>vendor/bin/phpunit</code> Xdebug will initiate a debugging session and
connect to your IDE.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="#troubleshoot">Troubleshooting</a> section if
it does not seem like Xdebug is activating.</p>

<h3>Browser Application <a name="browser-extensions" href="#browser-extensions">#</a></h3>

<p>The recommended way to initiate a debugging session is by configuring your
IDE to accept incoming debugging connections, and then use a browser extension
which sets the right trigger cookie.</p>

<h4>Browser Extension Initiation</h4>

<p>
The extensions are:
</p>
<a name="firefox-ext"></a>
<ul>
<li>
	<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/xdebug-helper-for-firefox/">Xdebug Helper for Firefox</a>
	(<a href="https://github.com/BrianGilbert/xdebug-helper-for-firefox">source</a>).
</li>
<li>
	<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc">Xdebug Helper for Chrome</a>
	(<a href="https://github.com/mac-cain13/xdebug-helper-for-chrome">source</a>).
</li>
<li>
	<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/safari-xdebug-toggle/id1437227804?mt=12">XDebugToggle for Safari</a>
	(<a href="https://github.com/kampfq/SafariXDebugToggle">source</a>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each extension adds an icon to your browser where you can select which
functionality you want to trigger. Xdebug will continue to start debugging for
every request as long as the debug toggle has been enabled.</p>

<h4>Manual Initiation</h4>
<p>Alternatively, you can signal Xdebug to initiate debugging for a
<strong>single</strong> request by adding
<code>XDEBUG_SESSION=session_name</code> as additional <code>GET</code> (or
<code>POST</code>) parameter. You can pick any value for
<code>session_name</code>, unless [CFG:trigger_value] is set.</p>

<a name="browser_session"></a>
<p>For debugging <strong>multiple</strong> subsequent requests, Xdebug supports
debugging sessions managed by a cookie.</p>

<p>Set the <code>XDEBUG_SESSION_START=session_name</code> <code>GET</code> (or
<code>POST</code>) HTTP parameter.</p>

<p>Xdebug will set the <code>XDEBUG_SESSION</code> cookie. As long as the
cookie is present, debugging will be initiated for every HTTP request
(including favicons and images if they go through PHP).</p>

<p>The time-out of the cookie is one hour.</p>

<p>If you set the <code>XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP</code> <code>GET</code> (or
<code>POST</code>) HTTP parameter, Xdebug removes the cookie.</p>


<h3>Alternative Ways of Triggering the Debugger</h3>

<p>There are other ways how debugger activation can be triggered.</p>

<h4>By Calling xdebug_break()</h4>

<p>Calling [FUNC:xdebug_break] will trigger a debugging connection as long as
[CFG:start_with_request] is set to <code>trigger</code> and no debugger session
is active yet. If a debugger session is already active, it will simply act as
if a breakpoint was set through your IDE.</p>

<h4>Upon an Error Situation</h4>

<p>If you set [CFG:start_upon_error] to <code>yes</code> then Xdebug will
trigger a debugging connection when a PHP Notice or Warning appears, or when a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.throwable.php">Throwable</a>
(Error or Exception) is thrown.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshoot" href="#troubleshoot">#</a></h2>

<p>You can troubleshoot Xdebug's attempts at initiating debugging connections
by configuring a log file through [CFG:log]. When the connection is
successfully established the log will also contain the communication between
Xdebug and IDE.</p>

<p>The log file will contain to which IP addresses it is attempting to connect
and at which ports, which should be a great help debugging why it sometimes
doesn't work. A "remote log file" is also required when reporting a bug in
Xdebug's step debugger.</p>

<p>There are several logging levels which can be configured through
[CFG:log_level].</p>

<p>The [CFG:log] setting requires as argument a full path to a file, to
which the user that PHP/Xdebug runs as can write to. It is advisable to use
something like <code>/tmp/xdebug.log</code>.</p>

<p><i>Be aware:</i> On many Linux distributions that run services through
Systemd, the actual file path could be different, such as:</p>

<pre>/tmp/systemd-private-80b2a71a8b9843c0b7c21b0d357e59cc-apache2.service-CN4RBr/xdebug.log</pre>

<h2>Implementation Details <a name="implementation-details" href="#implementation-details">#</a></h2>
<p>This section documents some implementation details, that are mostly useful
for authors of debugging clients that interact with Xdebug.</p>

<h4>DBGp: context_names</h4>
<p>
Xdebug's implementation of the
<a href="/docs-dbgp.php#context-names">DBGp protocol's <code>context_names</code></a>
command does not depend on the stack level. The returned value is always the
same during each debugger session, and hence, can be safely cached.
</p>

<h3>Custom DBGp commands</h3>
<p>
The DBGp protocol allows for debugger engine specific commands, prefixed with
the <code>xcmd_</code> prefix. Xdebug includes a few of these, and they're
documented here.
</p>

<a name="xcmd_profiler_get_name"></a>
<h4>DBGp: xcmd_profiler_name_get</h4>
<p>
If Xdebug's profiler is currently active (See: [FEAT:profiler]), this command
returns the name of the file that is being used to write the profiling
information to.
</p>

<a name="xcmd_get_executable_lines"></a>
<h4>DBGp: xcmd_get_executable_lines</h4>
<p>
This command returns which lines in an active stack frame can have a working
breakpoint. These are the lines which have an <code>EXT_STMT</code>
opcode on them. This commands accepts a <code>-d</code> option, which
indicates the stack depth, with <code>0</code> being the top leve stack frame.
</p>
<p>
The command returns the information in the following XML format:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;response
  xmlns="urn:debugger_protocol_v1"
  xmlns:xdebug="https://xdebug.org/dbgp/xdebug"
  command="xcmd_get_executable_lines"
  transaction_id="10"&gt;
	&lt;xdebug:lines&gt;
		&lt;xdebug:line lineno="2"&gt;&lt;/xdebug:line&gt;
		&lt;xdebug:line lineno="3"&gt;&lt;/xdebug:line&gt;
		&lt;xdebug:line lineno="4"&gt;&lt;/xdebug:line&gt;
		&lt;xdebug:line lineno="6"&gt;&lt;/xdebug:line&gt;
		&lt;xdebug:line lineno="8"&gt;&lt;/xdebug:line&gt;
	&lt;/xdebug:lines&gt;
&lt;/response&gt;
</pre>
