<h2>Debugger</h2>

<a name="DBG-E-NOCON"></a>
<dt>DBG-E-NOCON</dt>
<dd>
<p class="reason">
	Occurs when Xdebug is trying to connect to a debuging client to start a
	debugging session.
</p>
<p>
	The debugger could not make a connection to the client. The error message
	indicates which host and port combinations were tried, and through which
	configuration options it came to that conclusion.
</p>
<p>
	An example:
</p>
<p>
	<code>
	Could not connect to debugging client. Tried: ::1:9003 (from REMOTE_ADDR
	HTTP header), localhost:9003 (fallback through
	xdebug.client_host/xdebug.client_port)
	</code>
</p>
<p>
	This message indicates that Xdebug first tried to use <code>::1:9003</code>
	(IPv6's localhost) from the <code>REMOTE_ADDR</code> header, and then it
	fell back to <code>localhost:9003</code> as
	configured with [CFG:client_host] and [CFG:client_port].
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solutions:
	<ul>
		<li>Check whether your debugging client is listening on the indicated
		address and port. On Linux and OSX, you can use <code>netstat -a -n |
		grep LISTEN</code> to check.</li>
		<li>Change [CFG:client_host] and/or [CFG:client_port] to the right
		address/hostname and port of where the debugging client is
		listening.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</dd>

<a name="DBG-E-NOPERM"></a>
<dt>DBG-E-NOPERM</dt>
<dd>
<p class="reason">
	Occurs when Xdebug has no permissions creating a connection to the
	debugging client.
</p>
<p>
	This can happen because system configuration, such as SELinux, disallows
	a connection from being created.
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solutions if SELinux is enabled:
	<ul>
		<li>Set SELinux to <em>permissive mode</em>, by changing
		<code>SELINUX=enforcing</code> to <code>SELINUX=permissive</code> in
		<code>/etc/selinux/config</code>, and rebooting your machine.</li>
		<li>Allow <em>httpd</em> to make outwards connections by running:
		<code>setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on</code></li>

<a name="DBG-E-SES-INIT"></a>
<dt>DBG-E-SES-INIT</dt>
<dd>
<p class="reason">
	Occurs when Xdebug succesfully connected to a debugging client, but
	something went wrong sending the first data packet.
</p>
<p>
	This can happen if the socket that Xdebug connected to does not have a
	debugging client listening on it. For example, when it is PHP-FPM instead.
	Check that the port that PHP-FPM uses is not the same as the one that
	Xdebug uses. By default, they both use port <code>9003</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solution:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php#listen">Configure
		PHP-FPM</a> to use a different port than <code>9003</code>, or a Unix
		domain socket instead.</li>
		<li>Use [CFG:client_port] and your debugging client's configuration to
		change the debugging port to a different value (such as
		<code>9007</code>).</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</dd>

<a name="DBG-E-TIMEOUT"></a>
<dt>DBG-E-TIMEOUT</dt>
<dd>
<p class="reason">
	Occurs when Xdebug connection attempt times out.
</p>
<p>
	This can happen because no debugging client is listenting, a firewall
	prevents the connection by silently dropping connections, or when the
	latency is too high.
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solution:
	<ul>
		<li>Check whether a firewall is active, and if it is silently dropping
		connection attempts from Xdebug to the debugging client.</li>
		<li>Check whether your debugging client is listening on the address
		and port as indicated in the error message.</li>
		<li>Use [CFG:connect_timeout_ms] to increase the time-out value
		itself. A reasonable value for a time-out is anywhere from
		<code>200</code> to <code>2000</code> milliseconds.</li>
	</ul>

<a name="DBG-W-CON"></a>
<dt>DBG-W-CON</dt>
<dd>
<p class="reason">
	Occurs when [CFG:discover_client_host] is turned on, and Xdebug could not
	connect to the client with an address found in the HTTP headers.
</p>
<p>
	This can occur when networking is not correctly set up, or Vagrant and
	Docker networks are not configured correctly. Connecting back to the
	address of the machine where the debugging client runs only works if they
	are on the same network. If a networking set-up makes this impossible,
	then you can not use [CFG:discover_client_host].
</p>
<p>
	If the address found in the HTTP headers can not be contacted, Xdebug
	falls back to the static address as configured by [CFG:client_host].
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solutions:
	<ul>
		<li>Set [CFG:discover_client_host] to <code>0</code> and configure a
		static address with [CFG:client_host].</li>
		<li>If a debugging connection is working, ignore the warning or set
		[CFG:discover_client_host] to <code>0</code>.</li>
		<li>Check your networking set up so that the web server sees the HTTP
		request coming from an IP address on the same network as where the
		debugging client is listening. For example, you can check the latter
		on a Unix platform by running <code>ifconfig</code> and see if the IP
		address matches with what is sent in the HTTP headers.</li>

<a name="DBG-W-DETACH"></a>

<dd>
<p class="reason">
	Xdebug succesfully connected to an IDE or <a
	href="https://xdebug.cloud">Xdebug Cloud</a>, but the IDE or Xdebug Cloud
	aborted the debugging session with the <code>detach</code> protocol
	command.
</p>
<p>
	IDEs can detach for several reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>The IDE can detach when it can not relate the incoming request and associated file name with its path mappings.</li>
		<li>The IDE chooses to ignore the request on your behalf, through a dialog.</li>
		<li>The IDE chooses to ignore the request for other reasons.</li>
		<li>You can instruct the IDE to stop debugging, and let the application running.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solutions:
	<ul>
		<li>Set up the right path mappings for your IDE.</li>
		<li>Don't choose to ignore the incoming debugging session when the IDE asks.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Xdebug Cloud uses detach when the Cloud ID is not existing, or when no IDE
	is connected for the Cloud ID. A message with the exact reason Diagnostics
	Log that is part of [FUNC:xdebug_info]'s output.</p>
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solutions:
	<ul>
		<li>Check whether the Cloud ID as configured in Xdebug with
		[CFG:cloud_id] matches the one set in your IDE.</li>
		<li>Check your Xdebug Cloud <a

	to.
</p>
<p>
	If Xdebug can not find a header containing this information, it will fall
	back to address configured through [CFG:client_host]. If a debugging
	connection is succesfully created with that method, you can ignore this
	warning.
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solutions:
	<ul>
		<li>If a debugging connection was succesfully made, set
		[CFG:discover_client_host] to <code>0</code>.</li>
		<li>If you are running Xdebug on the command line, then no HTTP
		headers can be present. Set [CFG:discover_client_host] to
		<code>0</code>, or just ignore the warning.</li>
		<li>Use your brower's debugging tools to see which HTTP headers were
		sent to the HTTP server. If none were sent, then it is possible
		that a proxy server or Web server configuration stripped out the
		header(s). This is unlikely, as at least the <code>REMOTE_ADDR</code>
		HTTP header should always be present.</li>
		<li>If using [CFG:discover_client_header], check if you have not made a

<p>
	This warning indicates that an invalid header was present, perhaps
	maliciously.
</p>
<p>
	Suggested solution:
	<ul>
		<li>Use your brower's debugging tools to see which HTTP headers were
		sent to Xdebug, and find out which one contains <code>://</code>. Then

<p>
	A list of possible reasons:

		<li>Check whether the path after the initial <code>unix://</code>
