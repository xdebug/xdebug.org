Xdebug 2.6.0 is out!
<p>This is the first release of the Xdebug 2.6 series.</p>

<p>With this release, PHP 5 is no longer supported. In order to benefit from
bug fixes and new features in Xdebug, you will also have to upgrade to PHP 7,
preferably PHP 7.2.</p>

<p>Besides support for PHP 7.2, Xdebug 2.6 adds a significant set of new
features, as you can see on the <a href="/updates#x_2_6_0">updates</a>
page. A few highlights are: <strong>support for profiling memory usage</strong>,
<a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/stack_trace#filename_format">configurable
formatting of filenames</a>, statistics of PHP's <a
href="https://xdebug.org/docs/garbage_collection">Garbage Collector</a>, and
for the "remote" debugger:
"Notice" and "Warning" notifications are sent to the IDE, support for
low-ASCII characters in property names and array keys, support for NULL
characters in variable and property names, and <a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/remote#remote_timeout">configurable
connection timeouts</a>.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_6_0">updates</a> page, and I have written a
<a href="https://derickrethans.nl/xdebug-26.html">blog post</a> detailing many
of the new additions.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>This release also contains contributions by: <em>Arnaud Gendre, Benjamin
Eberlei, Chris Wright, Emir Beganović, Frode E. Moe, Kalle Sommer Nielsen,
Nikita Popov, Sara Golemon, Remi Collet, and Zaid Al Khishman</em> — Thanks!</p>
