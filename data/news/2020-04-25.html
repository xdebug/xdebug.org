Xdebug 2.9.5 is out!
<p>This bug fix release addresses two crash bugs; one when an exception was
thrown in a destructor, and another one where another extension compiles a PHP
file during request start-up. A Code Coverage anomaly is also resolved.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_2_9_5">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#2_9_5">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
