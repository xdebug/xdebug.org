Xdebug 2.9.1 is out!
<p>This bug fix release restores step debugging performance as it was in
Xdebug 2.7.2, while still maintaining the <a
href="https://derickrethans.nl/breakpoints.html">"resolved breakpoint"</a>
feature. Beyond improved performance for debugging, it also addresses a whole
range of smaller issues.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_2_9_1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#2_9_1">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>This release also contains a contribution by: <i>Ryan Mauger</i> â€”
Thanks!</p>
