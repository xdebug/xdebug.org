Xdebug 2.9.6 is out!
<p>This bug fix release addresses one crash bug when a third-party extension
(such as protobuf) contains classes that don't expose any properties. There is
also a fix to make the output of code coverage consistent when "branch
checking" is enabled. This release also sets the "SameSite" attribute on
cookies that Xdebug uses for step-debugging session management, but only for
PHP 7.3 and higher due to API limitations in PHP itself.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_2_9_6">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#2_9_6">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
