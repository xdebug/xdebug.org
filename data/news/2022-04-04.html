Xdebug 3.1.4 is out!
<p>
This is a bug fix release that addresses bugs related to the step debugger,
including debugging <code>ArrayObject objects</code>, crashes with closures with unset
static properties, and a crash when removing a duplicate "call" or "return"
breakpoint. It also fixes missing static array assignment lines with code
coverage, and adds a warning when zlib compression with
<code>xdebug.profiler_append</code> is used.
