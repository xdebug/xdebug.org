Xdebug 2.9.3 is out!
<p>This bug fix release addresses a bug with Xdebug's resolved breakpoints in
inherited classes, a bug with outdated behaviour with regards to PHP's
error_get_last(), and an incompatibility with other extensions that overload
opcodes.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_2_9_3">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#2_9_3">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
