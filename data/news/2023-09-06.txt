Xdebug 3.3.0alpha1 is out!
<p>
This is an alpha release to be able to test Xdebug with PHP 8.3. Not all the
features on the <a
href="https://bugs.xdebug.org/roadmap_page.php?version_id=101">Roadmap</a>
have been implemented, but neither is the scope for Xdebug 3.3 final yet.
</p>

<p>
Although the primary reason for this release is PHP 8.3 compatibility, there
are also a few features for the <code>xdebug_get_function_stack()</code>
method. Besides that, a few bugs have been fixed with regards to chained and
incomplete backtraces.
</p>

<p>
The full list of changes can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_3_3_0alpha1">updates</a> page.
</p>

<p>
The source code can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#releases">downloads</a> page, and as
usual, Xdebug is installable through PECL.
</p>
