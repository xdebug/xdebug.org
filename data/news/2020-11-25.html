Xdebug 3.0.0 is out!
<p>
Xdebug 3 includes major changes in functionality and configuration compared to
Xdebug 2. The primary way how you turn on functionality is through the new <a
href="https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#mode">xdebug.mode</a> PHP
configuration setting. This made it possible to massively increase performance
in many of Xdebug's sub systems as Xdebug is now much more conservative in
which hooks are enabled.
</p>

<p>Configuration changes, massive performance improvements, and PHP 8 support
are the primary features in Xdebug 3, but there is much more. The <a
href="https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide">upgrade guide</a> lists the
changes in great detail, and I have also rewritten many parts of the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/install">documentation</a> to make it easier
to get started with Xdebug's step debugging.
</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_3_0_0">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#releases">downloads</a> page, and as usual,
Xdebug is installable through PECL.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, please file a report at Xdebug's <a
href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">Issue Tracker</a> — especially if it considers
PHP 8 support.</p>

<p>This release also contains a contribution by: <i>Benjamin Eberlei,
Christoph Becker, Carlos Granados, Michael Voříšek, Jakub Zalas, Robert Lu,
and Tobias Tom</i> — Thanks!</p>
