Xdebug 2.6.0alpha1 is out!
<p>This is the first release with support for PHP 7.2, which came out last
week. This is not a <strong>final</b/> release, and it does have known issues,
including a crash bug.</p>

<p>With this release, PHP 5 is no longer supported. In order to benefit from
bug fixes and new features in Xdebug, you will also have to upgrade to PHP 7,
preferably PHP 7.2.</p>

<p>Besides support for PHP 7.2, it also adds a significant set of new
features, as you can see on the <a href="/updates#x_2_6_0alpha1">updates</a>
page. A few highlights are: <strong>support for profiling memory usage</strong>,
<strong>configurable formatting of filenames</strong>, and for the "remote" debugger:
"Notice" and "Warning" notifications are sent to the IDE, support for
low-ASCII characters in property names and array keys, and configurable
connection timeouts. You can follow the progress on the <a
href="https://bugs.xdebug.org/roadmap_page.php?version_id=51">roadmap</a>
page.</p>

<p>This release does come with several unresolved issues, and not all features
have been implemented yet. Xdebug 2.6.0 will be released in due course, with
additional features such as <a href="https://bugs.xdebug.org/view.php?id=1059">filters for tracing, stack traces, and code
coverage. </a>

<p>Windows DLLs are not yet available, but will be added once <a
href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/derickr/xdebug">AppVeyor</a> starts
working again.</p>

<p>The source code can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
