Xdebug 2.4.0RC4 is out!
<p>This is the fourth and hopefully last release candidate of the 2.4 series.
The 2.4 series adds support for PHP 7 and is in large parts a rewrite of the
earlier code base to support PHP 5.4 through PHP 7.0. This release candidate
fixes among others, a bunch of crashes, and adds support for PHP 7.1.</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_4_0RC4">updates</a> page. The source code can be found
on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
