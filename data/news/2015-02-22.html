Xdebug 2.3.0 is out!
<p>This release adds a whole lot of new features to Xdebug. The main new
features are support for <a
href='http://derickrethans.nl/path-branch-coverage.html'>path and branch
coverage</a> for code coverage, improvements for remote debugging with
exceptions, shared-secret triggers for profiling and tracing, a new variable
formatting option (serialized), and improvements in the size of profiling
files and break point checking.</p>

<p>This release drops support for PHP 5.2 and PHP 5.3, and raises the default
max nesting level to 256. It also fixes a bunch of issues as found in Xdebug
2.2.7.</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_3_0">updates</a> page and the source code and Windows
binaries can be found on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page. A
series of blog posts on the new features will soon follow on <a

updated documentation.</p>
