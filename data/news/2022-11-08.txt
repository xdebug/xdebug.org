Xdebug 3.1.6 is out!
<p>
This is a bug fix release that fixes two minor issues with remote debugging,
and an issue where on Windows compressed trace- and profile-files had
inadvertent line conversions, which made it impossible to uncompress them.
</p>

<p>
This will be the last release of Xdebug 3.1, and hence support for PHP 7 will
also cease, as indicated on the <a href='/docs/compat'>Supported Versions and
Compatibility</a> page.

<p>
The full list of changes can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_3_1_6">updates</a> page.
</p>

<p>
The source code can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#releases">downloads</a> page, and as
usual, Xdebug is installable through PECL.
</p>
