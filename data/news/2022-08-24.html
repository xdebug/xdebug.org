Xdebug 3.2.0alpha3 is out!
<p>
This release forces the new return value debugging step and information to
be on, to be able to test features in Xdebug that are not strictly supported
yet in all IDEs. This is likely a temporary change, which has a chance of
being reverted in the next release.
</p>

<p>
This is a source only release, without support for Windows.
