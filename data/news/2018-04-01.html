Xdebug 2.7.0alpha1 is out!
<p>This is an alpha release of the Xdebug 2.7 series.</p>

<p>The main reason for this release is the introduction of a resolution to an
<a href='https://bugs.xdebug.org/938'>issue</a>, in which Xdebug now allows for
working remote debugging of scripts that fork processes. Previously, Xdebug got
confused when an already existing debugging connection was shared among parent
and child processes. This releases addresses this by attempting to create a
separate connection for each child process. The resolution of this issue was
sponsored by Brad Wilson.</p>

<p>This release also contains some fixes made on the 2.6 branch.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_7_0alpha1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
