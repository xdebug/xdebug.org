Xdebug 2.9.2 is out!
<p>This bug fix release addresses a regression in writing trace files, where
the footer was no longer written, a crash when a third-party extension runs
code in RINIT, and an out-of-sync issue during debugging with a user defined
exception handler.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_2_9_2">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#2_9_2">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
