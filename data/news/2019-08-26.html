Xdebug 2.8.0beta2 is out!
<p>This is the second beta release in the Xdebug 2.8 series.</p>

<p>The 2.8 series primarily adds support for PHP 7.4, but also improves
Xdebug's breakpoint functionality by adding support for the
'resolved_breakpoint' flag.</p>

<p>This second beta release fixes a dozen bugs, and switches the Microsoft
Compiler version back to Visual Studio 2017, which is also <a
href='https://windows.php.net/#news-2019-08-21-1'>used</a> for the newly released PHP
7.4.0beta4.</p>

<p>Everybody is encouraged to try out this new version, but please be aware
that Xdebug 2.8.0beta2 <strong>is not fully ready</strong>. Which means that crashes
can still occur. If you find any problems, please report them to the <a
href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_8_0beta2">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

Xdebug Experience"</a> about the future of Xdebug, and how you can help

I also write monthly reports on Xdebug's progress on <a
