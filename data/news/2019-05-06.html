Xdebug 2.7.2 is out!
<p>This is the second (and likely last) bug fix release of the Xdebug 2.7
series.</p>

<p>This release disables Zend OPCache when the step debugger is active, and
fixes debugging issues with 'property_set' (for setting values),
remote_connect_back's IP address detection, and variable display for user
defined classes that have <code>__debugInfo()</code>.</p>

<p>Everybody is encouraged to upgrade to this new version.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_7_2">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
