Xdebug 2.7.0rc1 released!
<p>This is the first (and hopefully last) release candidate for Xdebug 2.7.</p>

<p>This release addresses a number of issues, with the most notable one being
an issue where Xdebug causes crashes due to a bug in OPcache in PHP 7.3.0 and
PHP 7.3.1. Xdebug now works around the issue when it is needed.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_7_0rc1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>Please test this release with PHP 7.3, and if you find problems, please
report them through the <a href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>.

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
