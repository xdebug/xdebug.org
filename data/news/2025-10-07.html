Xdebug 3.5.0alpha2 is out!
<p>
This is a preview release of Xdebug 3.5, also containing support for PHP 8.5.
</p>

<p>
The biggest new feature is the <b>Native Path Mapping</b> in the step debugger.
This which makes it possible for projects and developers to create mapping
definitions that maps files in directories, individual files, and even line
ranges in files, that are being run, to files that you would edit. This is
useful for generated files, compiled templates files, etc.
</p>

<p>
Path mapping also allows you to define directories, files, and lines in
files to skip. This makes it possible to exclude for example
<code>vendor/</code> directories etc. You can read more about this on the
dedicated <a href="https://xdebug.org/funding/001-native-path-mapping">Project
Page</a>, but please be aware that not everything has been implemented yet.
</p>

<p>
You can see path mapping and skipping in action, in a few teaser videos that I have produced:

<p>
Beyond Native Path Mapping, this release also adds experimental support for
Windows Named Pipes control sockets, exposes the value of the current exception
in a pseudo variable while debugging. There are also several bug fixes and
performance improvements.
