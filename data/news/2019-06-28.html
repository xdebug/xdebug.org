Xdebug 2.8.0alpha1 is out!
<p>This is the first alpha release in the Xdebug 2.8 series.</p>

<p>The 2.8 series primarily adds support for PHP 7.4, but also improves
Xdebug's breakpoint functionality by adding support for the
'resolved_breakpoint' flag. When IDEs opt in into this flag, Xdebug runs
additional logic to make sure that it tries to find the right line to break
on, even if you are setting a breakpoint on a line of code, where the PHP
engine doesn't think there is any code. Expect an article on my <a
href="https://derickrethans.nl/">website</a> soon.</p>

<p>Everybody is encouraged to try out this new version, but please be aware
that Xdebug 2.8.0alpha1 <strong>is not fully ready</strong>. Which means that crashes
can still occur. If you find any problems, please report them to the <a
href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_8_0alpha1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>This release also contains contributions by: <em>Arnold Daniels, and
Christoph M. Becker</em> â€” Thanks!</p>
