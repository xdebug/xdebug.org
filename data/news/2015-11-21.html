Xdebug 2.4.0RC1 is out!
<p>This is the first release candidate of the 2.4 series. The 2.4 series adds
support for PHP 7 and is in large parts a rewrite of the earlier code base to
support PHP 5.4 through PHP 7.0. This release candidate fixes a few bugs found
in the 2.4.0beta1 release. Among others problems with code coverage, tracing
and remote debugging. It also adds support for Windows.</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_4_0rc1">updates</a> page. The source code can be found
on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
