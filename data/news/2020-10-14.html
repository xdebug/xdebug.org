Xdebug 3.0.0beta1 is out!
<p class="warning">
This is a <strong>BETA</strong> release, and not ready for production environments.
</p>

<p>
Xdebug 3 includes major changes in functionality compared to Xdebug 2. The
primary way how you turn on functionality is through the new <a
href="https://3.xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#mode">xdebug.mode</a> PHP
configuration setting. This made it possible to massively increase performance
in many of Xdebug's sub systems as Xdebug is now much more conservative in
which hooks are enabled.
</p>

<p>Configuration changes, massive performance improvements, and PHP 8 support
are the primary features in Xdebug 3, but there is much more. The <a
href="https://3.xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide">upgrade guide</a> lists the
changes in great detail, and the there is (temporary) special sub-domain that
hosts the <a href="https://3.xdebug.org">Xdebug 3 documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>Please test Xdebug 3 for functionality. If you find a bug, please file a
report at Xdebug's <a href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">Issue Tracker</a> —
especially if it considers PHP 8 support.</p>

<p>I'm also interested to see what the performance optimisations have done for
your specific situation. Please let me know on Twitter by tagging <a

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_3_0_0beta1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#3_0_0beta1">downloads</a> page, and as usual,
Xdebug is installable through PECL. Windows binaries can (shortly) be found on
the <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/xdebug/3.0.0beta1/windows">PECL page</a>.</p>

<p>This release also contains a contribution by: <i>Benjamin Eberlei, Carlos
Granados, Michael Voříšek, Robert Lu, and Tobias Tom</i> — Thanks!</p>
