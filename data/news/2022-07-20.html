Xdebug 3.2.0alpha1 is out!
<p>
This is a preview release of the Xdebug 3.2 series to accompany the imminent
release of PHP 8.2 beta 1. Xdebug 3.2 adds support for PHP 8.2, and drops
support for PHP versions before 8.0.

<p>
This release also contains a few new features to step debugging. You can now
debug the return values of functions (with IDE support), and also configure
where the debugger needs to connect to with the <code>xdebug://gateway</code>
and <code>xdebug://nameserver</code> pseudo hosts as values of
[CFG:xdebug.client_host].
