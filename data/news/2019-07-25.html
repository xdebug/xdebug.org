Xdebug 2.8.0beta1 is out!
<p>This is the first beta release in the Xdebug 2.8 series.</p>

<p>The 2.8 series primarily adds support for PHP 7.4, but also improves
Xdebug's breakpoint functionality by adding support for the
'resolved_breakpoint' flag.</p>

<p>This first beta release makes Xdebug compile with the PHP 7.4beta1 release,
and also fixes a handful of other bugs.</p>

<p>Everybody is encouraged to try out this new version, but please be aware
that Xdebug 2.8.0beta1 <strong>is not fully ready</strong>. Which means that crashes
can still occur. If you find any problems, please report them to the <a
href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_8_0beta1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>This release also contains contributions by: <em>Joe Watkins, and
GCth</em> â€” Thanks!</p>
