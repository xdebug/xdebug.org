Xdebug 3.2.1 is out!
<p>
This is a bug fix release that mainly fixes issues with Xdebug's mode setting
in threaded environments, where Xdebug would ignore the value and always
enabled everything. This release also addresses a crash which occurs when you
try to set a standard php.ini setting which has been deprecated.

<a href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_3_2_1">updates</a> page.
</p>

<p>
The source code can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#releases">downloads</a> page, and as
usual, Xdebug is installable through PECL.
