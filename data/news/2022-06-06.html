Xdebug 3.1.5 is out!
<p>
This is a bug fix release that fixes a crash with <code>__callStatic</code>
and FFI and when Xdebug is used with Source Guardian encoded files. It also
solves an issue where the debugger would generate two XML attributes with the
same name for some variable types, confusing IDEs. It also solves a build
issue when <code>phpize --clean</code> is used.
</p>

<p>
This is likely the last release of the 3.1 series.
