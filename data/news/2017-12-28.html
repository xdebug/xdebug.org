Xdebug 2.6.0beta1 is out!
<p>This is the first beta release with support for PHP 7.2, which came out
last month. This is not a <strong>final</b/> release, and it does have known
issues, including a crash bug.</p>

<p>In addition to the changes in Xdebug 2.6.0alpha1, this beta release adds
filter support for tracing, stack traces and code coverage. Preliminary tests
shows that with the right filter this should speed up code coverage generated
through PHPUnit/PHP Code Coverage significantly. This release also fixes a few
bugs, and it includes configuration to run Xdebug's test suite automatically
on Windows through AppVeyor. Please note, that Xdebug 2.6 does no longer
support PHP 5.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_6_0beta1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>This release does come with several unresolved issues, and not all features
have been implemented yet. Xdebug 2.6.0 will be released in due course.</p>

<p>The source code can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
