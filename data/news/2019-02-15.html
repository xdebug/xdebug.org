Xdebug 2.7.0RC2 released!
<p>This is the second (and hopefully last) release candidate for Xdebug 2.7.</p>

<p>This release addresses a number of issues, including an issue where Xdebug
would instantaneously crash PHP due to ABI conflicts in PHP itself. Although
this well be addressed in PHP 7.3.3 and later, Xdebug includes a work
around.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_7_0RC2">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>Please test this release with PHP 7.3, and if you find problems, please
report them through the <a href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>.

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
