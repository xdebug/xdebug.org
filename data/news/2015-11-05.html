Xdebug 2.4.0beta1 is out!
<p>This is the first beta release of the 2.4 series. The 2.4 series adds
support for PHP 7 and is in large parts a rewrite of the earlier code base to
support PHP 5.4 through PHP 7.0.</p>

<p>A small number of fixes, notably regarding performance for code coverage
have been included as well.</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_4_0beta1">updates</a> page. Windows binaries will be
added in 2.4.0beta2, which will be available in the near future. The source
code can be found on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as
usual, Xdebug is installable through PECL.</p>
