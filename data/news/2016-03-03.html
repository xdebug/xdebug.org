Xdebug 2.4.0 is out!
<p>This new release brings support for PHP 7, and a few new features.
The new function monitoring allows you to define a list of functions with
<code>xdebug_start_function_monitor()</code>, and then every time that
function is used, it's calling location is recorded. And the new
xdebug.show_error_trace setting allows you to show a stack trace for every
Error (throwable).</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_4_0">updates</a> page. The source code can be found
on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
