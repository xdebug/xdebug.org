Xdebug 2.9.4 is out!
<p>This bug fix release addresses a crash bug introduced in Xdebug 2.9.3 that
fixed an incompatibility with other extensions that overload
opcodes. It also makes sure that the Step Debugger's 'detach' command does not
disable debugging for the rest of the PHP process.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="https://xdebug.org/updates#x_2_9_4">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#2_9_4">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
