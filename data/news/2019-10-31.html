Xdebug 2.8.0 is out!
<p>This is the first release of the Xdebug 2.8 series.</p>

<p>This version of Xdebug primarily adds support for PHP 7.4. It also
improves the reliability of honouring breakpoints when PHP's
internals generate code with different line numbers than you would expect.
This feature requires support in your IDE.</p>

<p>Beyond this, this release also fixes numerous memory leaks, bugs, and
incompatibilities with Zend Opcache. Everybody is encouraged to upgrade to
this new version.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_8_0">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>This release also contains contributions by: <i>Arnold Daniels, Christoph
Becker, GCth, Joe Watkins, Remi Collet, and Vincent Monier</i> â€” Thanks!</p>
