Xdebug 2.7.0 is out!
<p>This is the first release of the Xdebug 2.7 series.</p>

<p>This version of Xdebug primarily adds support for PHP 7.3. It also adds
support for single step debugging of forked PHP worker processes.</p>

<p>Beyond this meagre set of features, this release also fixes numerous memory
leaks, bugs, and incompatibilities with Zend Opcache. Everybody is encouraged
to upgrade to this new version.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_7_0">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>I have written a
<a href="https://derickrethans.nl/xdebug-experience.html">blog post "The
Xdebug Experience"</a> about the future of Xdebug, and how you can help
through becoming a supporter on
<a href='https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7864328'>Patreon</a>.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>This release also contains contributions by: <em>Christoph Becker, Peter
Kokot, Philip Hofstetter, Remi Collet, and Thomas Vanhaniemi</em> â€” Thanks!</p>
