Xdebug 3.1.0beta2 is out!
<p>
This is a packaging fix as 3.1.0beta1's package failed to compile on all
PHP 7.2 and PHP 8.1 versions.
</p>

<p>
The source code can be found on the
<a href="https://xdebug.org/download#releases">downloads</a> page, and as
usual, Xdebug is installable through PECL.
</p>

If you find a bug, please file a report at Xdebug's
