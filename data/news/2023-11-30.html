<p>
With flame graphs you can visualize hierarchical data, created to visualize
stack traces of profiled software so that the most frequent code-paths to be
identified quickly and accurately. You can read more about it in an <a
href="https://derickrethans.nl/flamboyant-flamegraphs.html">article</a>, or

<p>
The debugger sees significant performance improvements in relation to
breakpoints. It can now also show the contents of ArrayIterator,
SplDoublyLinkedList, SplPriorityQueue objects, and information about thrown
exceptions. There are also improvements with stepping in and around Fibers.
