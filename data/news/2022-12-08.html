Xdebug 3.2.0 is out!
<p>
This is the first release of Xdebug 3.2. This release adds support for PHP
8.2, and drops support for PHP 7.2 through PHP 7.4.

The main new features include being able to inspect the return value of
function calls while debugging; more and better warning messages when
setting breakpoints in non-existing files, or writing to PrivateTmp
directories; and, the addition of the pseudo host names xdebug://gateway and
xdebug://nameserver to facilitate easier set-ups in more complex networking
environments. Documentation and <a
