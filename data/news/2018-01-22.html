Xdebug 2.6.0RC1 is out!
<p>This is the first, and likely last, release candidate of Xdebug 2.6.0. The
major change in this release is the addition of
<a href="/docs/garbage_collection">Garbage Collection</a> statistics
functionality, contributed by Benjamin Eberlei.</p>

<p>Besides this addition, several bug fixes to Xdebug's remote debugging and
code coverage have been addressed. This is not a <strong>final</b/> release, but if
no problems are found it will be released as Xdebug 2.6.0 in about a week's
time. Please test Xdebug 2.6.0RC1 thoroughly, and report any issues through
the <a href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates#x_2_6_0RC1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
