September and October: Finished the Parser, and Starting Integration
<p>
	In the last two months, I finished the parser and improved the way how
	information is stored.
</p>
<p>
	The path mappings support distinct mappings per line, and I was storing
	each entry in a linked list. A linked list is a structure that contains
	data for one element, and then a pointer to the next one, like this:
</p>
<pre>
┌───────┐         ┌────────────────────┐
│ head* │ ──────► │ remote lines: 1-4  │
│ tail* │ ──┐     │ local lines:  1-4  │
└───────┘   │     │ next*  ─┐          │
            │     └─────────┼──────────┘ 
            │               ▼
            │     ┌────────────────────┐
            │     │ remote lines: 5-8  │
            │     │ local lines:  5    │
            │     │ next*  ─┐          │
            │     └─────────┼──────────┘ 
            │               ▼
            │     ┌────────────────────┐
            │     │ remote lines: 9-13 │
            │     │ local lines:  6-10 │
            │     │ next*  ─┐          │
            │     └─────────┼──────────┘ 
            │               ▼
            │     ┌────────────────────┐
            └───► │ remote lines: 14   │
                  │ local lines:  11   │
                  │ next*  ─┐          │
                  └─────────┼──────────┘ 
                            ▼

<p>
	With this structure, mapping remote line 14 to local line 11 means
	traversing the whole linked list, starting from the head. This is not so
	bad with only 4 items, but when there are hundreds, this becomes slow, with
	the worst case having to search through all the items (<i>O(n)</i>).
</p>
<p>
	Instead of a linked list, the new implementation now uses a <b>Vector</b>,
	which uses a fixed size data structure per entry:
</p>
<pre>
┌──────────┐       ┌────────────────────┐
│ head*    │ ────► │ remote lines: 1-4  │
│ count: 4 │       │ local lines:  1-4  │
└──────────┘       ├────────────────────┤
                   │ remote lines: 5-8  │
                   │ local lines:  5    │
                   ├────────────────────┤
                   │ remote lines: 9-13 │
                   │ local lines:  6-10 │
                   ├────────────────────┤
                   │ remote lines: 14   │
                   │ local lines:  11   │
                   └────────────────────┘
</pre>
<p>
	With a structure like this, it is now possible to do a <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search">binary search</a> over
	all the elements. A binary search algorithm works by looking whether the
	item we are looking for is the middle item that we are working on. If it is
	not, it the searches either in the first half or the second half of what
	still needs to be searched. The computational complexity for that is much
	better: <i>O(log n)</i>.
</p>
<p>
	In some benchmarking, this made looking up the right element significantly
	faster, but the data structure itself is also more compact, as we don't
	need to keep track of the <code>next*</code> pointer, and the array can be
	indexed directly.
</p>
<p>
	One thing that I have not added yet, is a reverse mapping as well. Right
	now, the algorithms can only map remote a file/line to a local file/line,
	but in order to be able for an IDE to set a breakpoint on a local file line
	(which is how you would edit it), it also needs to have a reverse map.
</p>
<p>
	In November I will work on that, and making sure that checking whether
	there is a breakpoint on a line, as well as setting breakpoints, now use
	the native path mapping. Right now, I don't expect this to be in Xdebug
	3.4, as I will need to release this earlier to be able for the users to
	have a debugger that works with PHP 8.4 the moment it comes out. PHP 8.4's
	release date is currently scheduled for November 21st.
</p>
<p>
	I have spent 16½ hours in September and October on Native Xdebug Path Mapping.
