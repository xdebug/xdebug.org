July: Creating the Parser
<p>
    In this first month, or rather, the last week of July, I have been working
    on setting up a testing framework
    for the parser. Previously Xdebug only had tests in
    <a href="https://qa.php.net/write-test.php">PHPT</a> form, PHP's standard
    for
    testing syntax and functions. However, this is rather more an integration
    test framework, as it compares the output of a script with an expected
    output.
</p>
<p>
    For low-level features, such as testing the implementation of the parser
    that parses the path mapping files, PHPT tests are not suitable. Instead,
    the testing framework tests the return values and generated structures
    directly, without PHP having to be involved. The
    <a href="https://cpputest.github.io/manual.html">CppUTest</a> framework
    that I use for this, is much more similar to PHPUnit. It is also a framework
    that I have used for testing
    <a href="https://github.com/derickr/timelib">timelib</a>,
    the library that powers PHP and MongoDB's date/time functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the testing framework, I have also made a start on the parser itself.
    It can currently parse the <code>remote_prefix</code> and
    <code>local_prefix</code> stanzas, as well as mapping lines, although it
    does not distinguish between directory maps, file maps, or line maps yet,
    nor does it apply the prefix stanzas yet.
</p>

    I have spent 6 hours in July on Native Xdebug Path Mapping.
