June through October: Testing, More Testing, and Then Some More Testing
<p>
In the last months, I have finished the initial preview of Native Path Mapping,
and I have just released Xdebug 3.5.0alpha2 which contains this preview.
</p>
<p>
Since the last update, I also realised that it is actually quite important to
also allow for certain directories, paths, and lines to be skipped. This makes
the feature also useful to ignore <code>vendor/</code> directories, or similar,
while debugging. It also makes it possible to fast-forward through generated
lines of code that don't have an original equivalent line. Instead of
specifying a location to map to, you can use the <code>SKIP</code> keyword
instead.
</p>
<p>
You can see this in action in a new <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYmCjrBwNNg">video</a> that I recorded.
</p>
<p>
This required a bit more engineering, as the original data structures that I
had devised could not handle this. This meant that this took therefore more
time than I had allocated. Luckily, other aspects went faster so the project is
still within budget.
</p>

<p>
I will still need to add more functional tests, and implement the function to
allow for parsing extra path map files. It is also very likely I will need to
come up with a more comphrehensive file format, as mapping lines to other lines
is now a very cumbersome and repetitive task. In addition to that, I might also
think about adding a function that allows a program to specify other
directories to consider for parsing files.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WI-81344/Cant-Set-Breakpoints-in-Template-Files-Even-Though-I-Added-The-File-Name-Pattern-to-PHP">ticket</a>
that I filed with JetBrains for PhpStorm to allow setting breakpoints in
non-PHP files has not yet been looked at, although it is now assigned to an
engineer. I hope to see if I can convince them to look at this. Again, this is
not a problem with the VS Code PHP Debugging Plugin.
</p>

<p>
Now that 3.5.0alpha2 is out, it is also time to put the feature through its
paces. <em>Which means that I am asking you to test it!</em> You can see some examples
in the official test suite. There is one for
<a href="https://github.com/xdebug/xdebug/tree/master/tests/debugger/maps/map-single-line">mapping single line</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/xdebug/xdebug/tree/master/tests/debugger/maps/skip-single-line">skipping a single line</a>,
and
<a href="https://github.com/xdebug/xdebug/tree/master/tests/debugger/maps/skip-vendor-directory">skipping a vendor directory</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you encounter any issues, please add a new issue in the <a
href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>, specifying the <em>Path
Mapping</em> category while doing so.
