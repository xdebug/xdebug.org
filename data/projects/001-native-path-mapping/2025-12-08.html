November: More Testing, a Bug Fix, and a Release!
<p>
Last week I have <a href='https://xdebug.org/announcements/2025-12-04'>released
Xdebug 3.5</a>, which contains the first version of Native Path Mapping. This
means that it is now possible to checkout the feature, and put it through its
paces. Now is the time to discover where it works well, and where we still want
to make changes and/or improvements.
</p>
<p>
Since the last message, I tested it with some of my own projects — mainly with
the the <code>SKIP</code> feature to skip the <code>vendor/</code> directories.
</p>
<p>
I did find a <a href="https://bugs.xdebug.org/2374">bug</a> (now fixed) and
adding support for Windows ended up harder than I would have thought.
</p>
<p>
In the next few days I will be publishing a guide in the <a
href='https://xdebug.org/docs/'>documentation</a> on how to use the feature in
great detail.
</p>
<p>
This isn't quite the end of the project though, as I will still need to add a
function (<code>xdebug_set_source_map()</code> in the <a
href='https://xdebug.org/funding/001-native-path-mapping'>plan</a>.
</p>
<p>
But for now, please check it out, and let me know what you think!
