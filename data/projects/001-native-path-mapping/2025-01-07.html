November and December: Relative and Reverse Mappings
<p>
	In the last two months, I added support for relative (to the current
	working directory) mappings, as well as reverse mappings.
</p>
<p>
	Reverse mappings are needed to map local path names to remote path names,
	for example when an IDE wants to set a breakpoint. The IDE only knows about
	the path names as they are locally, and Xdebug needs to convert these into
	the path names that the remote uses (ie, the place where PHP and Xdebug
	run).
</p>
<p>
	There are three types of mappings: full directory mappings; file mappings;
	and file mappings with line ranges. I wrote how Xdebug stores line ranges
	in a previous post.
</p>
<p>
	Each item itself is linked to from a hash table, where they can be found
	via a key consisting of a local path name. For reverse mappings, we need to
	have an additional hash table where items can be found through a key
	created from the <b>remote</b> path name.
</p>
<p>
	A naive implementation would also clone the data as well, which is indeed
	what my first implementation did too. But there is an alternative way,
	which is reference counting.
</p>
<p>
	Not to be confused with user-level references, PHP also employs this
	mechanism to vastly improve its speed. Simplified, when you do <code>$new =
	"Very long string â€¦"; $new = $old;</code>, PHP does not copy the string
	when you assign the value to <code>$new</code>. Instead it remembers how
	often the string content has been <i>referenced</i> to, by increasing its
	"refcount" by one. When a variable leaves a scope, or gets reassigned, PHP
	will decrease the refcount by one. Only when the refcount reaches zero, PHP
	will free the associated string.
</p>
<p>
	We can do the same for the information for each item in our mapping list.
	Instead of cloning (copying the associated memory) of an item, we can store
	a reference count. Each time we add it to a hash table, we increase it by
	one. When a hash table gets destroyed, it will also then "destroy" the
	associated data by decreasing its reference count by one again. Just like
	with PHP, only when the reference count reaches zero, the associated
	information is freed.
</p>
<p>
	This new algorithm will be the first that I implement in the new year,
	before continuing with the integration of the maps wherever Xdebug uses
	filenames and line numbers.
</p>
<p>
	I have spent 4 hours in November and December on Native Xdebug Path
	Mapping, which is far less than I intended.
