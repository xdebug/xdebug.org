Path mappings are a feature in IDEs that allow remote directories to be mapped to local directories. This is necessary when PHP and Xdebug run in a remote environment, including containers, where the paths that contain PHP files differ from the local machine where they are edited.</p>
<p>In some cases mapping specfic files containing PHP code, or template code, to other files or even line ranges is required. This project adds functionality to Xdebug to handle these cases.
