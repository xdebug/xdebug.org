	<h1>Support</h1>

	<p>
	Xdebug is an Open Source project, and is developed on a voluntary basis, with
	generous support of <a href="/#business_supporters">business-tier sponsors</a>,
	patrons on <a href='https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7864328'>Patreon</a>,
	and sponsors on <a href='https://github.com/sponsors/derickr'>GitHub</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you think you have have found a problem with Xdebug, you must report bugs through our <a
	href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>. Please read our <a
	href="/reporting-bugs">guide</a> on how to report bugs effectively first.
	</p>

	<p>
	The issue tracker is not a support forum, and any issues that are not
	deemed to be a bug, will be closed.
	</p>

	<p>
	Unless you have a commercial arrangement with us, all support must happen in an
	<em>open accessible place</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Without a <a href='/support-commercial'>commercial support agreement</a> in
	place, Xdebug's developers will <em>not</em>:
	<ul>
		<li>provide private support via email</li>
		<li>debug users' private projects, services, or servers</li>
		<li>sign any contract or NDA</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
